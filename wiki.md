# What is Coastal Process?

## The basics

The three principle marine processes that influence coasts are:
* **erosion**
*  **transportation** and
*   **deposition**. 

**Erosion** refers to the breaking down of the land by the force of waves. **Transportation** is the work of waves and tides in transferring this broken material somewhere else and **deposition** refers to the process by which waves and tides lose energy, cease to transport and release eroded material.

# Driving forces

Two drving forces of coastal processes are:

* **Wave** produced by wind at sea
* **tide** produced by gravitational effect of sun and moon.

# Driving forces and marine processes
## *Four ways waves and tides erodes the shoreline*
* **Hydraulic action**
* **abrasion**
* **attrition**
* **solution**

## *Four ways waves and tidal currents transport material*
* **Solution**

* **suspension**

* **Saltation**

* **Traction**
